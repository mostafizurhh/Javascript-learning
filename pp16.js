// Module 16 - Javascript practice problem

//1. Shihan's dad gave him 500tk and asked him to buy some 2kg orange and 3kg apples. The price for fruits is 56tk and 59tk per kg. Write a program to help Shahan calculate how much money the shopkeeper will return.

// Solution1:

// var totalMoney = 500;
// var applePrice = 60;
// var orangePrice = 50;

// var totalApplePrice = applePrice * 3;
// var totalOrangePrice = orangePrice * 2;
// var totalCost = totalApplePrice + totalOrangePrice;

// var remainingMoney = totalMoney - totalCost;

// // console.log(remainingMoney);

// 2. Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics,Biology,Chemistry,Physics and Bangla of a student.

// Solution2:

// var Mathematics = 80;
// var Biology = 70;
// var Chemistry = 75;
// var Physics = 85;
// var Bangla = 90;

// var totalMarks = Mathematics + Biology + Chemistry + Physics + Bangla;
// var average = totalMarks / 5;

// console.log(average);

// Solution4:

var givenNumber = 17;
var dividend = 5;

var reminder = givenNumber % dividend;
console.log(reminder);
